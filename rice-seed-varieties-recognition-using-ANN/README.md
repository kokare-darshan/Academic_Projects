Agricultural field is one which can benefit a lot from the advances in technology. There is a large variety of rice harvested each year. The varieties can be differentiated by the farmers or individuals with knowledge related to the agricultural field. However, to the common people, the differentiation of grain types based on their looks is very difficult and such a task invites a large scope of error. Also, vendors can be fooled by claims of variety or quality of a particular type of grain to be of a higher grade than it actually is. The task of recognizing the type of grain becomes tedious and troublesome because the ultimate buyer i.e. consumer, needs to be able to purchase exactly the type of grain they require.  Quality of grains is a vital prerequisite for todayâ€™s souk, to prevent the individual from getting charged for lower quality grains at a higher cost. Even if the person, is able to identify the variety, the quality is something that is much more difficult. The reason for this is the fact that commoners are not used to identify the quality and hence the vendors take advantage of this disability of the consumer.
